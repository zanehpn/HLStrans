Kernel Description:
The CORDIC (Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer) algorithm is a highly efficient iterative method used for computing trigonometric functions such as sine and cosine. This implementation of the CORDIC algorithm is designed to compute the sine and cosine of a given angle in radians. The algorithm iteratively rotates a vector in the Cartesian plane towards the desired angle, using a series of predefined rotations. The CORDIC algorithm is particularly useful in hardware implementations due to its simplicity and low computational complexity, as it primarily relies on additions, subtractions, and bit shifts.

The algorithm operates by maintaining a vector that starts along the x-axis and rotates it towards the target angle by a series of smaller angles. Each iteration involves a rotation by a fixed angle, which is chosen from a predefined table of angles. The angle table is generated such that the sum of the angles converges to the desired angle. The CORDIC algorithm can be configured for different modes, such as rotation mode, vectoring mode, and hyperbolic mode. In this implementation, we are using the rotation mode to compute sine and cosine.

The CORDIC algorithm can be described by the following equations:
- \( x_{i+1} = x_i - y_i \cdot d_i \cdot 2^{-i} \)
- \( y_{i+1} = y_i + x_i \cdot d_i \cdot 2^{-i} \)
- \( \theta_{i+1} = \theta_i - \theta_i \cdot d_i \)

Where:
- \( x_i \) and \( y_i \) are the coordinates of the vector at iteration \( i \).
- \( \theta_i \) is the angle of the vector at iteration \( i \).
- \( d_i \) is the direction of rotation, which is +1 if the target angle is greater than the current angle, and -1 otherwise.
- \( \theta_i \) is the angle of rotation at iteration \( i \).

The algorithm iterates for a fixed number of iterations (32 in this case) to achieve the desired precision. The initial vector is scaled by a constant factor \( K \) to ensure that the magnitude of the vector remains constant throughout the iterations. The value of \( K \) is given by:
\[ K = \prod_{i=0}^{N-1} \sqrt{1 + 2^{-2i}} \]
Where \( N \) is the number of iterations. For 32 iterations, \( K \approx 0.607252935 \).
